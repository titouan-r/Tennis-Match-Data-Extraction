A Python project to extract past tennis match data by webscraping oddsportal.com


This project demonstrates how to extract past tennis match data from [Oddsportal.com](https://www.oddsportal.com) using Python and Selenium. It includes scripts to scrape match details such as player names, scores, and odds.

## How it Works

- ChromeDriver (or any other compatible driver for your browser of choice)

## Usage

1. Install the required Python packages.
2. Run the script to start scraping the data.
